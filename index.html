                    <p>"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received 
                        to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in 
                        its various forms. If anyone speaks, they should do so 
                        as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone 
                        serves, they should do so with the strength God 
                        provides, so that in all things God may be praised 
                        through Jesus Christ."
